# BSKY-Enhancer
Quality of life improvements for BSKY, including enforced highest quality video playback.

## FEATURES:
- Source-quality video playback. `(Seeking the video won't work on Chrome, due to long-standing Chrome issue.. Works on Firefox)`
- Download video button below posts.
- Download filename with proper attribution e.g: `porigoshi.bsky.social_2024-09-13_3l3zt66nogq2o.mp4`, so files are user and date sorted. Contains post ID to find that post on their account again too!
- Adds a "Copy Link" button below videos to automatically copy it as a `bskye.app` link, so the video will embed properly when pasted elsewhere.

>I intend to add features like I have in my Twitter-AutoHD script, most importantly the right-click saving images too that includes creator's details in the filename, and video downloading.<br/>
>(May add timeline width adjustment at some point as well.)
